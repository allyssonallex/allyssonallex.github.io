          <p>
            Highly experienced as a Professor, Researcher, and Project Manager,
            I am moved by the purpose of making people thrive through a mix of
            education and information technology towards a better tomorrow. For
            this reason, I am a huge believer in how valuable it is to build
            innovative and interdisciplinary opportunities in well-aligned
            partnerships between academy, industry, public organizations, and
            society. As a strong team player, I persistently seek to achieve
            collective goals with a proactive, organized, result-oriented, and
            creative endeavor.
          </p>

              </h3>
              <p>
                Social, human, and economic aspects strongly impact the success
                of Information Systems (IS). Therefore, understanding these
                aspects is fundamental to evaluating how methods, tools, and
                people may improve IS analysis and development. From a
                sociotechnical perspective, we investigate the role of
                organizations, management, psychology, and sociology, including
                how going through the whole software engineering poses critical
                knowledge for IS practice. By approaching different theoretical
                lenses, our research aims to investigate the social, human, and
                economic aspects of IS to advance how these systems are
                built/used and how this knowledge may address societal
                challenges.

              <h3>Software Engineering Education and Training</h3>
              <p>
                A software engineer requires a balanced set of soft, technical,
                and interdisciplinary skills. Then, one can highlight the
                relevance of advancing software engineering education and
                training, which are essential to forming the best engineers to
                deal with real-world challenges. Hence, we aim to investigate
                through this research line the different educational paths that
                could be taken and combined to provide students the capability
                of being highly qualified professionals in the context of
                software engineering and, consequently, enable them to recognize
                the software quality notions from a product perspective, but
                also the principles from a process outlook.

                Management and Engineering Practices for Innovation and Digital
                Transformation
              </h3>
              <p>
                Digital transformation is an organizational change triggered by
                digital technologies that can impact how organizations operate
                and deliver value to people. In other words, digital
                transformation is linked to strategic shifts in the business
                model, product development, data analytics, and innovation due
                to implementing digital technologies required to qualify
                organizations' competitiveness and capabilities. Grounded in a
                multidisciplinary and analytics-driven perspective, we
                investigate across management and engineering practices to
                catalyze innovation and digital transformation in promising
                projects from different domains.
